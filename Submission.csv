I love the city but on arrival I found it really difficult to find a well furnished apartment in a good neighborhood that I could let on a flexible/short term basis.  Consequently a little while down the line, now I have found my feet I've decided to start a business, Urvana LLC, to provide exactly this! 

But I also want to provide more than just a place to stay - I think everybody has a better time seeing cities when they visit friends or family and get shown the best places and given local knowledge from people who live in the city.  That is what I am aiming to provide with Urvana - giving guests a great experience of DC with local knowledge and great service that you won't find from traditional travel companies. 

Having run a few apartments on AirBnB for a while I realized that where landlords need the most help is with a cleaning and turndown service.  So another AirBnB host David McDermott and I have set up a cleaning company specifically tailored for hosts, AirCleanNSheen.  We service any hosts in the DC Metro area to help take the hassle out of hosting, send me a message or look up our website if you need a cleaning/turn down service.

We are not obligated to take any reservation if we don't feel comfortable with the inquiry. We may decline late night check ins. 
Remember, 
We do not offer the flexibility and amenities of a hotel, hence the lower price at our place. You are not staying at a hotel, this is just one of our downtown houses , OR you are staying in one of  our apartments , or depending on which listing you chose, you may be staying with us in our apt, in our extra bedroom. ,so If you're expecting hotel service, please stay at one.  
We tend not to take stressful reservations or what we call drama reservations.  If you are not understanding of old houses(built in 1904). Such as maybe for example waiting  60 seconds for the water to get hot, or somewhat creaky 112 year old hard wood floors....please stay somewhere else.    
And, Most people come in usual check in times. If you must come late, please let us know first before making the reservation, and we may consider just giving you the front door code, and you just letting yourself in.

Remember, 
We do not offer the flexibility and amenities of a hotel, hence the lower price at our place.

And, Most people come in usual check in times. If you must come late, please let us know first before making the reservation, and we may consider just giving you the front door code, and you just letting yourself in.

My wife and I are busy professionals who work in politics and journalism. We have family in Vermont who manage the property there for us. What follows is applicable exclusively to our DC property, but I am happy to supply tons more info about Vermont. 

In DC, we're looking for sweet-natured, self sufficient guests for our spare room, which comes with its own living room and private bath . 

Most of our renters are here for internships, fellowships, rotations and so on. Our house is perfect for a short-term situation for people whose lives are elsewhere. But we are happy to accept renters who are here just for a day or so.

Our own bedroom/ bath is at the front of the second floor; in the back are two bedrooms, a private bath, and a washer dryer. We sometimes rent out the two rooms in the back. That includes all utilities except phone. Your space has a small refrigerator, coffeemaker and a microwave, which our renters use instead of the kitchen.

Rent also includes fast wifi, premium cable/ satellite television including HBO, a DVD/VCR, and a cleaning lady who comes every two weeks.  The back of the second floor is basically your space and you can use the larger of the two bedrooms more or less as a living room.

The room comes with bed, all linens including towels, iron and ironing board, hangers, dresser and a bookshelf. The living room has a futon, TV and coffee table. The setup is designed so that you need only show up with your suitcase. We also have a bike, lock and helmet --it's incredibly easy to zip downtown, U St, H St, Dupont Capitol Hill, wherever, on the bike, and most of our renters have enjoyed having it. You're of course also welcome to bring your own bike, or a car -- let us know if we'll need to get you a temp parking permit. There's also a Capital Bikeshare docking station just two blocks from our house.

Robin and I are quiet, private, hardworking professionals in our early 40s. I am a journalist, she works in politics.We prefer to rent to similarly quiet, private people who are respectful of our space.

We have a very well-behaved dog who never enters the back of the second floor. Street parking is ample and safe. The neighborhood is in transition, as they say, but it’s very central and friendly and we don’t know anyone who has ever had a problem. I walk/bike to work downtown every day and our house is Bloomingdale adjacent-- three blocks from the superlative Big Bear coffeehouse, and also super close to Uncle Chips coffee, the Washington Firehouse, the DC Smokehouse, a terrific, inexpensive yoga studio (the Bloomingdale Yoga District), Red Hen, Rustik, Boundary Stone, the Pub and the People, etc.

Additionally, there is a Harris Teeter supermarket and restaurants right by the NoMa metro. We are very close to XM, NPR, Howard University, Children's Hospital and Georgetown Law (NOT the main campus.)

On the whole our renters have been on hectic schedules and just need someplace clean, quiet and civilized to come home and crash. We look for renters who have lives elsewhere and won't be bringing people over. You must be comfortable with our no-guests rule. (I know it sounds strange, but in Washington, there are plenty of people here just for the short term for whom it's not a problem.)

We're friendly and want to ensure your comfort but expect you'll be capable of maneuvering around the city and letting yourself in and out on your own.

I've since studied in Guatemala, Argentina, Italy and The Netherlands. I lived for years in Ecuador and Mexico. I fell in love with culture and how it shapes every part of our lives, even how we think. My best travel experiences are always the ones where I have an unplanned encounter with people I meet along the way. Two very dear relationships in my life today began in the Piazza del Campo in Siena Italy -- 10 years apart! 

HOSPITALITY: My love of hospitality began in Guatemala when I lived with a family for the summer and was deepened when I spent a month in a township in Capetown, SA. The house in Capetown was quite small. My friends insisted that I take their bed and they slept in the living room on the floor. I have since made my home a gathering space for friends and for years was part of an informal house of hospitality where we hosted guests from around the world, well before the days of Airbnb. Now that I have my own home in DC, I am THRILLED to be able to open it up to guests from Airbnb. I hope we get a chance to meet.

LIFE IN WASHINGTON: I moved to DC five years ago. I have grown to love this city, its history, gorgeous architecture, different neighborhood vibes, endlessly interesting people, amazing food scene (cooking, and well, eating, are my other great passions), and plenty of free stuff to do. The day I moved into my house, although it was a cold December day, my neighbors came out  to greet me. Within 2 weeks I was offered Christmas dinner by my next door neighbor because she knew I wasn't traveling to Minnesota for the holidays. DC is much more the nation's seat of power.

We are a family of four, plus one loveable 11 year old dog, originally from Texas that has lived in DC since 2009. While we are incredibly busy at the moment with work, grad school, two toddlers and life in general, we are eager to welcome you and yours into our home. 

Marco (or Mark) works as a government contractor while Bess is working on a Masters degree in speech pathology. We spend a lot of time with neighborhood friends either at home or around the DC area. In addition to frequent trips to visit family in Texas, we love to travel internationally (yes, with the kids). Spanish is the second language in our home, though Mark also speaks French and some Portuguese.  

About our home/the apartment:
We live in a 1916 Arts and Crafts bungalow on a lovely residential street with friendly neighbors, ample street parking, and easy access to public transportation. We are in the (slow) process of making updates to the interior and exterior of the home, including hopefully one day fully expanding the finished portion of the basement.

We have rented the apartment ever since we bought the house in 2009 to long-term tenants but with growing children and frequent out of town guests, we are hoping to make the space a regular part of our home in general. That said, when you are renting it, the space is entirely yours.

As hosts, we will do everything we can to make you feel comfortable and welcome. Honestly though, with our hectic schedules we may not be as hands-on as other hosts. This is not to imply we are not friendly or don't want to get to know you--but sometimes we are barely keeping our heads above water and may not be able to spend a lot of personal time with you. In turn, we completely understand if you prefer a more private experience and will always respect your privacy.

I have served three terms as an elected official in the District of Columbia (what was I thinking...) founded Smith & Crane LLC (R&D) and currently practice architecture. 
I enjoy sports, politics, public speaking and enlightening conversations of all perspectives (the glass of wine is optional). There is much to do in this walkable neighborhood from fine dining to live music.  I would be more than happy to help you find your way around. If time permits I can even serve as a tour guide. 
Take care and I look forward to meeting you.

I was born here in Washington DC and love the beat of this city.  I've had several businesses; most lasting for more than 45 years. I know a lot about DC history and love telling interesting stories of yesteryear! 

I am very friendly but have a great knack at serious business.  It all began in 1969 when me and Hilton Felton, my music director, started our youth singing group named ""Ed Gerald Gospel Sounds"". Consequently, for more than 23 years I produced a local (Metropolitan DC) Gospel Show called, ""Spread a Little Sunshine"", on TV - WTOP, WUSA--CBS Channel 9. Simultaneously, I recorded and produced gospel music; started Paradise Productions Studio next door to this building, then obtained the current building in 1995. This current building produced records under the labels ""Paradise Productions"", ""Energy for God Record Company"", Gospel World of E.G., then ""EG Record Company."" Many notable gospel artists were produced in this building, including the Dorsey Team of Dr. Clayton Hannah and Dr. Thomas A Dorsey. 

People who have stayed at my property have had a pleasant fun stay and usually don't like leaving on-time which is ok with me too!  

Each of my rented rooms are arranged for your privacy as much as possible (even the few rooms with some shared spaces). These rooms will have some significant historical meaning of my times in DC during the years of TV or Radio producing or recording music or shows that were also performed and presented in metropolitan Parks and Recreation.

If you ask not you receive not, is my favorite motto!  Be encouraged...life is truly too short.

Before booking: Link your Airbnb profile to a social network, verify your phone number; and  complete your Airbnb profile. If your profile is not complete, upon checkin, expect us to ask to view a photo ID and possibly make a copy for our private records. The purpose is for emergencies and security, like hotels would expect.

After booking: Make sure you send a note letting us know when we will expect your arrival. You may give us your travel itinerary, for instance.  It will be helpful in arranging your checkin, if you plan to arrive within our usual 4pm checkin timeframe. If you expect to arrive more than 1 hour later than the estimated time you gave us, call or send a text updating your arrival time. If we have waited longer than an hour and don't hear from you, you may get charged $20 cash when you check in, for arranging to return or getting someone else to let you in.

When you get the opportunity to stay as our guest(s), make sure you read the online House Manual for clarity in your stay and especially your checkout procedures. The Manual is located near the description of the room you selected and booked. Please read details so that you don't get locked out, for instance. 

With some locations of the rooms there might be noises that you are not familiar with. This building is located on a busy travel street also. If you are sensitive to noise, we suggest you bring ear plugs.

Remember that Airbnb is not for guests expecting perfection, but for travelers who appreciate getting to know a host and our surroundings, and bonding with the neighborhood and who appreciate saving money. There are many hotel locations in DC but are two to three times or more the price per night.

We expect you to keep your room(s) and immediate area tidy as possible during your stay. This will help you to follow checkout procedures, avoid additional cleanup fee charges, and when you leave, possibly avoid leaving anything behind.  

You may text or call us anytime before, during, or as you check out with any questions about your visit. Thank You and Welcome to Our Nations Capital, DC!

I can schedule for a basic driving tour of NW DC including Smithsonian, NatL Archives, Air & Space Museum; Iwa Jima Memorial, US Capital, Supreme Court, White House, Washington Monument, and a few more popular sites around NW Washington. I charge $45/hour for your group, up to 4 people. By the hour charges only apply (no halfs calculated). This Is daytime 9-6. After 6pm til midnight, $55/hour basic evening/night tour.   Ask about my airport transportation service as well. I operate in all the metropolitan airports.  If you're interested in the above,  let me know in advance what you prefer for scheduling.

If you are driving and want to know what to do about parking in our neighborhood, there are some options.  There is free street parking. However, its imperative you follow street signs for areas that require you to move your car during street cleaning times. You must watch the dates and times when its restricted. Also, watch ""Residential Zone"" parking. Hefty fines are issued if there are violations and/or you may be subjected to towing. Make sure you do not fail to adhere to DC's parking restrictions!

If you expect to stay and park in our neighborhood for longer than two weeks with another State license plate, you need to go to DMV to get a temporary parking permit. (The District's Parking Enforcers will keep track).  There are also downtown parking lots and garages. You can find them on a ""Parking Panda"" App. If you don't want to be concerned about the parking, i also rent a parking space behind the home and I would need to schedule you, if its available during your stay.

We do not offer the flexibility and amenities of a hotel, hence the lower price at our place. You are not staying at a hotel, this is just one of our downtown houses , OR you are staying in one of  our apartments , or depending on which listing you chose, you may be staying with us in our apt, in our extra bedroom. ,so If you're expecting hotel service, please stay at one.  
We tend not to take stressful reservations or what we call drama reservations.  If you are not understanding of old houses(built in 1904). Such as maybe for example waiting  60 seconds for the water to get hot, or somewhat creaky 112 year old hard wood floors....please stay somewhere else.    
And, Most people come in usual check in times. If you must come late, please let us know first before making the reservation, and we may consider just giving you the front door code, and you just letting yourself in.

My wife is an artist. We own a business together. We're an eco-conscious couple who like to live life to its fullest, embrace the good things and good people that are all around, travel a bit, try different ethnic foods from all over the world, explore music from all genres, cook, and entertain in our new house! 

In April of 2012, after living in DC since 2008, my wife and I bought this 100-year-old house (circa 1913) within 2.5 miles of the White House, and we intend to live here for a long time, so we've really gone all out to make this home special. We spent many hours and much love to spruce it up and make it our home. Now we want to share it with others who share our love of travel and big-city life. 

My wife is from New Delhi, India, so we go there as often as we are able (not often enough, though). We met in Bloomington, Indiana while she was in graduate school and I was running for County Commissioner of Monroe County. Now we're living it up in the capital city, which is a real gem of a city. We'd love to share our favorite places with you, help you find the perfect restaurants, and help you find things to do that are off the beaten paths of the typical DC tourists. 

We do have a cat, so if that's a problem, there's nothing we can do about that. She's a short-haired black tabby cat, born in 2000, and is very independent. Her name is Zapatista (or Zappa for short, since her caretaker [Mike] is a huge fan of the Zapatistas of Chiapas, Mexico, as well as a fan of Frank Zappa), and she likes people to be around her, but she's not real crazy about too much affection (a little goes a long way with her). 

Our house is in a great neighborhood called Columbia Heights. It's about a 12-minute walk to the nearest Metro subway station (also called Columbia Heights), and there are bus stops and a Capital Bikeshare station right around the corner from our house, so it's easy to get around! Taxi cabs are also easy to hail if you'd rather go that way.

Originally from Europe, Washington DC has been my home town for quite some time now. I work in research and like to make room for the things I enjoy the most in life - music, snow/skate/kiteboarding, friends, dogs, classic SAAB 900s, and the English Premiership.I also very much enjoy a meaningful conversation with intelligent people. 

AirBnB has become a cause and a lifestyle for me both as a host and as a traveler.  I am a big supporter of the people-powered sharing economy and I believe in folks networking to enjoy new experiences and new places while at the same feeling part of a community and avoiding generic and overpriced hotels. For me, hosting is traveling and making friends around the world without leaving my home, while also making my guests feel at home when they are away from home. I enjoy sharing and helping you have a comfortable stay and experience as many of the thrills my city has to offers as you can take : ) 

I know Washington DC well and depending on what you like and have time for, I would help you explore the different faces of the city: its history, museums, monuments, and politics; its vibrant neighborhoods with a thriving restaurant scene, farmers markets, and a good number of eclectic places that offer creative selections of crafty coffee, microbrews and spirits; its cultural life and international and ethnic aspects; its nightlife and live music scene. 

I have a few simple house rules to be observed and in return, I am very flexible with the arrangements and accommodation.

I would like to take this time to thank you for considering one of our listings. Please note that we have six total listings, and so at any time we can have a full house. There are two full bathrooms in the house, so the downstairs bathroom is shared and the upstairs bathroom is shared with the rooms upstairs. For the traveler who loves people, our home is perfect. Also, we live in a quiet neighborhood and the house is a quiet space, so we are also perfect for those looking for a quiet place to rest after a day of D.C. exploration! We are LGBTQ and family friendly. 

My name is Claire Sutter and I am a proud D.C. native and current new resident. I have most recently returned from a 6 month trip in China, but also love traveling all around the US. I am a lover of nature and outdoors, love farming and agriculture, hula hooping and dancing, practicing yoga, visiting new places around the world and close to home. I love to cook, clean (having a clean home is very important to me!), entertain, and overall enjoy life in DC!! 

The five things I can't live without are good foods and drinks, good people and family, music and entertainment, knowledge, and animals. Since I can't live without these things, they are an integral part of my life.  We love sharing meals and having beer or wine with our guests. Live music and concerts are my favorite, and some of the housemates play music! We all love reading and having discussions about everything, and encourage conversation with us around the house at any time! Lastly, animals are very important to me. We have a cat named Achilles who lives with us in our apartment downstairs, but he also loves being outside. If he ever meows at the door, you may let him in. 

 Our style of traveling is very relaxed, we don't mind being off the beaten path, and we love interacting with all kinds of people. This reflects our hosting style as well. We are very kind and clean people, friendly and outgoing. We have lots of places we can show you that you may not be able to find in any travel book or blog, and would love to help show you those parts of the DC area! 


We hold events at our home as much as possible. We are always open to ideas for any activity that interests you. We love hosting guests for meals, drinks, or just hanging out.  All are welcome!

I have been living in DC for five years now -- working in federal healthcare policy and constantly finding great, new things about this historic city. I love meeting new people from around our small world and I am truly excited to host you! I will do my best to make your stay as comfortable as possible. I believe the little details are what counts: A mint on your pillow; bamboo towels and sheets; a friendly smile greeting you.

The details: I am an attorney at a law firm  downtown and manage pretty long hours so I may not be around too much during the weekdays. However, I do love wandering around our little neck of the woods when I have time. Petworth is a great place to call home and our house is warm, comforting, and clean. 

I have one roommate that lives upstairs with me (there are four bedrooms in total.) His name is Eric and he is a great guy, working at a think-tank downtown. I also have a young puppy named Ruby who is very excited to meet you! Ruby is crated during the day (when I am not home) so you don't see her romping around without me. Don't worry - she may bark but will warm right up to you.For rent are one of our guest bedrooms, as well as the loft/attic space.  

We keep the house very clean and it tends to be fairly quiet. If you are looking for a nice place to come home to at the end of the day, a place that takes away a bit of life's stress, you've come to the right place.  I always do my best to make sure you are as comfortable as possible and if there are any special requests, please just let me know ahead of time and I will do my best to accommodate you.",100%,70%,Petworth,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'linkedin', 'reviews', 'kba']","Brightwood Park, Crestwood, Petworth",Washington,DC,20011,D.C.,"Washington, DC",US,United States,House,Private room,2,1.5,1.0,1.0,Real Bed,"{TV,""Cable TV"",Internet,""Wireless Internet"",""Air Conditioning"",Kitchen,""Free Parking on Premises"",""Pets live on this property"",Dog(s),Heating,Washer,Dryer,""Smoke Detector"",""Carbon Monoxide Detector"",""First Aid Kit"",""Fire Extinguisher"",Essentials,Shampoo}",,1,2,21,102,97.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,9.0,10.0,f,moderate,2,2.06

I am very exited about the work that I do - I work in strategy for one of the larger consulting firms in DC. I've had the opportunity to bring creative ideas and solutions to a varied group of clients both commercial and federal.

When traveling, I often times spend minimal time (1-2 days) on the well-known tourist locations. The majority of the time I enjoy meeting locals and asking them what they do for fun!

I returned from Yemen & Afghanistan to DC to finish my degree and had to get an apartment. However I am scheduled to return overseas for a bit and would like to offset the cost of my rent while I am away while providing you a much cheaper alternative to DC hotels. 

I have zero criminal history and have passed a ridiculous number of intensive background checks. In fact I just got my first parking tickets, but I am appealing those (probably to no avail because DC's parking laws are horrible). 

I retain an International Relations background with extensive history in conflict zones and a notable academic history in similar regions. Having lived in DC for over half a decade, and being here while an undergraduate I know most of the water holes and sights if you need input.

My travel style (45 countries & counting) is usually a balance between seeing the key tourist sites and enjoying a robust night life. I have friends around the world I try to meet up with and here in DC I have a huge network. Over the years I have hosted countless friends and friends of friends where ever I have lived. Having stayed at many people's places over the years I know how critical a good host is.

I am adaptive to almost any situation and personality and abide by the mi casa su casa mentality for anyone staying here. I would not be here while you are staying here so you have the whole place to yourself. I think I do well balancing an extensive professional career while being super laid-back. I am social enough that on a whim I can have 30 people show up to a last minute party, yet relaxed enough to spend the weekend in my apartment.

The Market itself was designated a National Historic Register in 1971 and its origins trace back to a 1805 proclamation by Thomas Jefferson and the original city design plan by Pierre L’Enfant. Today the neighborhood evidences urban redevelopment and gentrification. The tree-lined red brick sidewalks border turn-of-the-century Victorian and Federal rowhouses populated by professionals, young singles, and families with young children. The residences are mingled with diverse retail offerings, small professional offices, parks and civic/community locales like The Hill Center and the Folger Shakespeare Library.  A key component of the neighborhood is Barracks Row, the oldest commercial district in the city due to its proximity to the Washington Navy Yard - established in 1799, and the U.S. Marine Barracks - established in 1801.

Consequently a little while down the line, now I have found my feet I've decided to start a business, Urvana LLC, to provide exactly this! 

But I also want to provide more than just a place to stay - I think everybody has a better time seeing cities when they visit friends or family and get shown the best places and given local knowledge from people who live in the city.  That is what I am aiming to provide with Urvana - giving guests a great experience of DC with local knowledge and great service that you won't find from traditional travel companies. 

Having run a few apartments on AirBnB for a while I realized that where landlords need the most help is with a cleaning and turndown service.  So another AirBnB host David McDermott and I have set up a cleaning company specifically tailored for hosts, AirCleanNSheen.
